    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My Name is Kevin Lloyd, I love playing video games specifically Super Mario or Zelda games, my favorite Music genre
        is pop music and my favorite artist is Michael Jackson, my favorite food is anything Italian like
        pizza or chicken bread-crusted Parmesan. My future career is to be a software & webdev developer and I hope to put my coding
        skills to create video games. I am a hard-working person, and although I am not perfect I also try to achieve a goal I set for myself.
    </p>
